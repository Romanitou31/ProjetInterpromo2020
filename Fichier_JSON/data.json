J'espère qu'elle vous plaira !!!**e vol 587 était un vol opéré par American Airlines sur un Airbus A300 pour effectuer la liaison entre New York et Saint-Domingue en République dominicaine. L'avion s'est écrasé le 12 novembre 2001, peu après son décollage de l'aéroport international John-F.-Kennedy, sur un quartier résidentiel du Queens. Les 260 occupants de l'avion (9 membres d'équipage et 251 passagers) et 5 personnes au sol, périrent.Le vol 587 est autorisé à rouler depuis la porte d'embarquement jusqu'à la piste 31L vers 9 h 0, heure locale. Il suit un Boeing 747-400 de la Japan Airlines qui décolle juste avant lui, à 9 h 12. À 9 h 13, le contrôleur prévient l'équipage du vol 587 des risques de vortex de sillage occasionnés par la masse imposante du 747 et autorise le décollage. Le commandant de bord donne les commandes de l'avion au copilote pour qu'il réalise le décollage. À 9 h 14, l'avion s'aligne sur la piste, et s’élance 1 minute et 45 secondes après le 747 précédent.Après avoir rentré le train d'atterrissage, l'équipage reçoit l'instruction de suivre la même trajectoire de sortie que le 747, par un virage à gauche. À 9 h 15, le commandant contacte le contrôle de New York et reçoit l'autorisation de grimper à 13 000 pieds. À ce moment-là, l'équipage entend une série de bruits probablement occasionnés par un vortex de sillage[réf. nécessaire]. 15 secondes plus tard, à 9 h 15 min 36 s, l'avion est dévié sur la droite. Les gouvernes de direction sont actionnées violemment de gauche à droite. À 9 h 15 min 51 s, un deuxième vortex, plus puissant, frappe l'avion. À 9 h 15 min 54 s, le copilote demande « la puissance maximale ». Il y a de nouveau un mouvement de gauche à droite sur la gouverne de direction et il se produit une série de bruits et un grand bang quand la gouverne est ramenée à fond à droite. L'empennage vertical venait de se séparer de l'avion et l'Airbus plonge vers le sol depuis une altitude d'environ 2 900 pieds (870 mètres). Durant la descente, les moteurs se séparent des ailes et l'avion s'écrase à 9 h 16 sur un quartier résidentiel du Queens.Le vol a duré 2 minutes et 24 secondes.**Retrouvez-moi sur les réseaux sociaux :-Twitter : https://twitter.com/kbakovian-Google+ : https://plus.google.com/u/0/100773635...N'hésitez pas à :-liker-vous abonner : https://goo.gl/2G243X-partager la vidéo-EXPLOSER la barre de pouce bleus !!!J'espère vous revoir très bientôt, et à la prochaine !!! :)",

    "Review": "Bravo for this real documentary FSX Bakovian..I remember very well this horrible accident that occurred shortly after the (fals) .. the pardon attacks of 9/11/2001 ..Memember that there is a video running on YT showing workers at Ny airport, filming the last moments of flight 585 .. I remember that co-pilot Stan Molin, who unfortunately completely screwed up, doing anything with the controls of the tail of the Airbus at 300/600, making sure to \"stress\" the structure of the aircraft as much as possible .... I have to say that this co-pilot flew most of the time on a Mac donnel douglas md80 or 83, plane where you could activate the tail pedals of the aircraft in all directions, in windy conditions, as was the case during the last flight of the Airbuus A300 ... In short peace to the souls of 257 passengers, ..peace to the Souls of the flight attendants .... peace to the Souls of the pilots Edward States and Stan Molin ..... unfortunately There is always, unfortunately, that there is breakage, so that such a dramatic accident does not happen again.",

    "Author": "musico81986",
    "Description": "This is a re-edited video in high definition of my previous video I had. American Airlines flight 928 from Guatemala City to Miami, onboard an Airbus A300-600. Includes preboarding, boarding, taxi, and takeoff. From the terminal, you can see the VOR transmitter (114.5 MHZ). Note how close the airplane comes to the adjacent hangars during taxi. You can also see the \"Water Volcano\" in the background. After takeoff, you can see \"El Obelisco\", the main roundabout where main roads in Guatemala meet. I ommited push-back and initial taxi run because there was a lot of condensation on my window. Apperantely this A300 flies in the night before, and stays overnight for the morning flight-out. You can see the condensation breaking away on my window. Sorry about that. I also do NOT have my arrival into guatemala because I arrived early in the morning when its dark. I was sitting across from the flight attendants and they noticed my camera and warned me to keep it off when told. Next time, I'll pick a day-flight! Enjoy!",

    "Description": "This is a re-edited video in high definition of my previous video I had. American Airlines flight 928 from Guatemala City to Miami, onboard an Airbus A300-600. Includes preboarding, boarding, taxi, and takeoff. From the terminal, you can see the VOR transmitter (114.5 MHZ). Note how close the airplane comes to the adjacent hangars during taxi. You can also see the \"Water Volcano\" in the background. After takeoff, you can see \"El Obelisco\", the main roundabout where main roads in Guatemala meet. I ommited push-back and initial taxi run because there was a lot of condensation on my window. Apperantely this A300 flies in the night before, and stays overnight for the morning flight-out. You can see the condensation breaking away on my window. Sorry about that. I also do NOT have my arrival into guatemala because I arrived early in the morning when its dark. I was sitting across from the flight attendants and they noticed my camera and warned me to keep it off when told. Next time, I'll pick a day-flight! Enjoy!",

Includes preboarding, boarding, taxi, and takeoff. From the terminal, you can see the VOR transmitter (114.5 MHZ). Note how close the airplane comes to the adjacent hangars during taxi. You can also see the \"Water Volcano\" in the background. After takeoff, you can see \"El Obelisco\", the main roundabout where main roads in Guatemala meet. I ommited push-back and initial taxi run because there was a lot of condensation on my window. Apperantely this A300 flies in the night before, and stays overnight for the morning flight-out. You can see the condensation breaking away on my window. Sorry about that. I also do NOT have my arrival into guatemala because I arrived early in the morning when its dark. I was sitting across from the flight attendants and they noticed my camera and warned me to keep it off when told. Next time, I'll pick a day-flight! Enjoy!",

    "Description": "A little tribute to the American Airlines Airbus A300 which is being retired from the fleet.  The A300 is a very unique aircraft.  Many of us enjoyed working on the \"bus\", others...not so much.  ;)  This video is for those of us who did.  All of these photos were taken on, or around the A300.   I tried to get as many people in the video as possible.  The song is \"You and I\" by Celine Dion.  Hope you enjoy!",

Many of us enjoyed working on the \"bus\", others...not so much.  ;)  This video is for those of us who did.  All of these photos were taken on, or around the A300.   I tried to get as many people in the video as possible.  The song is \"You and I\" by Celine Dion.  Hope you enjoy!",

    "Review": "Nice report, Paul.  I have around 2000 hours flying the B717.  The cockpit is identical to a MD-11(minus one engine), the engines are very powerful Rolls Royce turbofans, however the wing is very old DC-9  design.  It climbs out like a bat out of hell but just kind of gives up around 32 to 34000 feet.  To make a nice smooth landing you give kind of push the nose down during the flare, it's counter intuitive so until you figure it out some hard landings can be had with this jet.  At 10:21 that is Mt. Hood in the distance.  Cheers.",

Almost unheard of in Europe now, this was a great opportunity to capture one of these rare beasts. This was a great flight - though the 04:15 start did not help! Props to Delta for retaining at least some complimentary service in economy. I love flying rear engined aircraft and the 717 didn't disappoint, with its 3-2 seating in economy. Just a shame Delta doesn't give lounge access to Skyteam elite fliers travelling domestically, but that's Delta for you...Do you have any ideas for future trip reports?

For this short domestic flight to Portland in Oregon I chose Delta, solely because of the equipment - a Boeing 717. Almost unheard of in Europe now, this was a great opportunity to capture one of these rare beasts. This was a great flight - though the 04:15 start did not help! Props to Delta for retaining at least some complimentary service in economy. I love flying rear engined aircraft and the 717 didn't disappoint, with its 3-2 seating in economy. Just a shame Delta doesn't give lounge access to Skyteam elite fliers travelling domestically, but that's Delta for you...Do you have any ideas for future trip reports?

Props to Delta for retaining at least some complimentary service in economy. I love flying rear engined aircraft and the 717 didn't disappoint, with its 3-2 seating in economy.

    "Review": "Thanks for such a nostalgic -to-me  video.  When I was in college, DC=9's were new.  the Pratt & Whitney engines were louder and smokier, and the fuselage was shorter.  I flew several times a month on either a Delta or a TWA DC-9, it seemed.  I had a brief-case--you may not have even heard of those, since everything they did has been replaced by an iPad--that was designed just to fit on the drop-down trays so I could get some work done. The other planes on which I flew frequently then included the Convair 880, long gone, and the Caravelle when I flew United.  The Caravelle was actually my favourite, and was in many ways the inspiration for the 9. I certainly would not have expected that basic design to have so many variants and such a long service life.",

    "Description": "Hello everyone, and welcome to my latest trip report, on board this Delta 717-200 from Huntsville, Alabama to Atlanta, Georgia, in Economy Class (Main Cabin)! Delta's 717 is always nice to fly on, but the 2 hour delay on the inbound flight really mucked up the rest of my trip... I'm still fairly new to the fast-growing trip report genre here on YouTube, so I welcome any feedback or suggestions for future trip reports! Hope you all enjoy.

    "Description": "Hello everyone, and welcome to my latest trip report, on board this Delta 717-200 from Huntsville, Alabama to Atlanta, Georgia, in Economy Class (Main Cabin)! Delta's 717 is always nice to fly on, but the 2 hour delay on the inbound flight really mucked up the rest of my trip... I'm still fairly new to the fast-growing trip report genre here on YouTube, so I welcome any feedback or suggestions for future trip reports! Hope you all enjoy.

    "Title": "Delta Airlines - Boeing 717 FULL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE/FLIGHT REPORT Newark to Atlanta (720p HD)",
    "Author": "CathayA340 Aviation",
    "Description": "For today's video, here is a full flight experience on board Delta Airlines' Boeing 717 from Newark to Atlanta!This flight was Delta Airlines Flight 2453 DAL2453/DL2453 with service to Hartsfield Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL) from Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR/EWR).The aircraft I flew was N915AT, a Boeing 717-231, which had it's first flight in March 2001, making the aircraft 13.6 years old!During the video, I was sitting in Seat 23E.FLIGHT EXPERIENCE :Information about Delta Airlines : Delta Airlines is one of the \"big 3\" carriers of the United States, and serves many destinations in the world internationally with a large variety of aircraft. Delta's fares are usually low cost and they offer good in-flight entertainment most of the time. The legroom is also good on most of their airplanes.Seats : Delta has the usual First Class and Economy Class. They offer a section called Economy Comfort which is located in the coach cabin, which has better legroom and more boarding time. Find out more about Economy Comfort on Delta's website : http://bit.ly/PUkkBvThe seat configuration of Delta's Boeing 717-200's is 2 x 3.Delta's 717 seats are comfortable, soft and have nice legroom. The recline is also pretty good for a plane like this. Find the seat information here at Delta's site : http://bit.ly/1G48wTwDelta offers USB and power ports onboard the plane throughout the ENTIRE cabin for FREE!Food/Beverage : Delta uses the standard carts to haul food and drinks around the aisles of the airplane. They offer complimentary Coca Cola beverages and 3 choices of free snacks, which include mini pretzels, cinnamon cookies and peanuts. Delta pours the drink into the a plastic cup. See the dining options here : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Flight Attendants : The flight attendants on board this flight were excellent, very accommodating and always had a smile on their faces - I can tell that they enjoyed their jobs and loved to help others! Out of my several Delta flights, all of the flight attendants were great.Turbulence : There was none during this flight, a very smooth ride. Delays : We were on schedule and arrived early on this flight! Good job to Delta for no delays :)In-Flight Entertainment : On this flight, there were no Personal TV's or any AVOD entertainment - the 717 fleet is not equipped with these because they are used for short haul routes. The entertainment included the magazines...and looking out the window ;) Just kidding...there is also On-Demand audio streaming in all classes of the 717. There is also gogo in-flight WiFi available for purchase at a low price.Baggage Costs : I did not choose to check in any bags, I put my luggage in the overhead compartments. If I did check a bag, it would have to weigh under 50 lbs and not exceed over 62 inches in total dimensions (length + width + height). And of course, you are allowed one personal item and one carry-on item for free! Anyways, please check out this link for more info on Delta's baggage policies : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Overall, Delta Airlines is the best out of the three major US carriers in my opinion. Usually, you can't go wrong with them unless there is a major problem. With the low prices and all the amenities you receive for free, Delta is always worth it!-----------------------------Aircraft InformationAirline : Delta Airlines DAL/DLAircraft : Boeing 717-231 B712Flight : DAL2453/DL2453Airport : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRHartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRunway : Runway 22L and 8LOrigin : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRDestination : Hartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRegistration : N915ATFlight Aware : https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N...Date of Filming : August 27, 2014Camera(s) : Canon Powershot SX-40HSVideo Editor : CyberLink PowerDirector Version 12Seat : 23ECruising Altitude : 34,000 feetSpeed : 453ktsDistance : 777 smRoute : KEWR EWR1 LANNA PTW BYRDD HAAGN PENSY EMI CSN MOL FLASK AVERY BEBAD ODF FLCON DIRTY2 KATLFlight Duration : 1 hour 38 minutesDeparture Time : 2:30 PM EDTArrival Time : 4:08PM EDT------------------------------------------------------Channel Website : http://www.nycplanespotting.weebly.comSubscribe : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...Google Plus : https://plus.google.com/b/11028113178...*NEW* Instagram : http://instagram.com/cathaya340_plane...------------------------------------------------------© CathayA340 Planespotting 2014This video may not be used without permission.",

Delta's fares are usually low cost and they offer good in-flight entertainment most of the time. The legroom is also good on most of their airplanes.Seats : Delta has the usual First Class and Economy Class. They offer a section called Economy Comfort which is located in the coach cabin, which has better legroom and more boarding time. Find out more about Economy Comfort on Delta's website : http://bit.ly/PUkkBvThe seat configuration of Delta's Boeing 717-200's is 2 x 3.Delta's 717 seats are comfortable, soft and have nice legroom.

Out of my several Delta flights, all of the flight attendants were great.Turbulence : There was none during this flight, a very smooth ride. Delays : We were on schedule and arrived early on this flight! Good job to Delta for no delays :)In-Flight Entertainment : On this flight, there were no Personal TV's or any AVOD entertainment - the 717 fleet is not equipped with these because they are used for short haul routes. The entertainment included the magazines...and looking out the window ;) Just kidding...there is also On-Demand audio streaming in all classes of the 717. There is also gogo in-flight WiFi available for purchase at a low price.Baggage Costs : I did not choose to check in any bags, I put my luggage in the overhead compartments. If I did check a bag, it would have to weigh under 50 lbs and not exceed over 62 inches in total dimensions (length + width + height). And of course, you are allowed one personal item and one carry-on item for free! Anyways, please check out this link for more info on Delta's baggage policies : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Overall, Delta Airlines is the best out of the three major US carriers in my opinion.

    "Description": "For today's video, here is a full flight experience on board Delta Airlines' Boeing 717 from Newark to Atlanta!This flight was Delta Airlines Flight 2453 DAL2453/DL2453 with service to Hartsfield Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL) from Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR/EWR).The aircraft I flew was N915AT, a Boeing 717-231, which had it's first flight in March 2001, making the aircraft 13.6 years old!During the video, I was sitting in Seat 23E.FLIGHT EXPERIENCE :Information about Delta Airlines : Delta Airlines is one of the \"big 3\" carriers of the United States, and serves many destinations in the world internationally with a large variety of aircraft. Delta's fares are usually low cost and they offer good in-flight entertainment most of the time. The legroom is also good on most of their airplanes.Seats : Delta has the usual First Class and Economy Class. They offer a section called Economy Comfort which is located in the coach cabin, which has better legroom and more boarding time. Find out more about Economy Comfort on Delta's website : http://bit.ly/PUkkBvThe seat configuration of Delta's Boeing 717-200's is 2 x 3.Delta's 717 seats are comfortable, soft and have nice legroom. The recline is also pretty good for a plane like this. Find the seat information here at Delta's site : http://bit.ly/1G48wTwDelta offers USB and power ports onboard the plane throughout the ENTIRE cabin for FREE!Food/Beverage : Delta uses the standard carts to haul food and drinks around the aisles of the airplane. They offer complimentary Coca Cola beverages and 3 choices of free snacks, which include mini pretzels, cinnamon cookies and peanuts. Delta pours the drink into the a plastic cup. See the dining options here : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Flight Attendants : The flight attendants on board this flight were excellent, very accommodating and always had a smile on their faces - I can tell that they enjoyed their jobs and loved to help others! Out of my several Delta flights, all of the flight attendants were great.Turbulence : There was none during this flight, a very smooth ride. Delays : We were on schedule and arrived early on this flight! Good job to Delta for no delays :)In-Flight Entertainment : On this flight, there were no Personal TV's or any AVOD entertainment - the 717 fleet is not equipped with these because they are used for short haul routes. The entertainment included the magazines...and looking out the window ;) Just kidding...there is also On-Demand audio streaming in all classes of the 717. There is also gogo in-flight WiFi available for purchase at a low price.Baggage Costs : I did not choose to check in any bags, I put my luggage in the overhead compartments. If I did check a bag, it would have to weigh under 50 lbs and not exceed over 62 inches in total dimensions (length + width + height). And of course, you are allowed one personal item and one carry-on item for free! Anyways, please check out this link for more info on Delta's baggage policies : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Overall, Delta Airlines is the best out of the three major US carriers in my opinion. Usually, you can't go wrong with them unless there is a major problem. With the low prices and all the amenities you receive for free, Delta is always worth it!-----------------------------Aircraft InformationAirline : Delta Airlines DAL/DLAircraft : Boeing 717-231 B712Flight : DAL2453/DL2453Airport : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRHartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRunway : Runway 22L and 8LOrigin : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRDestination : Hartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRegistration : N915ATFlight Aware : https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N...Date of Filming : August 27, 2014Camera(s) : Canon Powershot SX-40HSVideo Editor : CyberLink PowerDirector Version 12Seat : 23ECruising Altitude : 34,000 feetSpeed : 453ktsDistance : 777 smRoute : KEWR EWR1 LANNA PTW BYRDD HAAGN PENSY EMI CSN MOL FLASK AVERY BEBAD ODF FLCON DIRTY2 KATLFlight Duration : 1 hour 38 minutesDeparture Time : 2:30 PM EDTArrival Time : 4:08PM EDT------------------------------------------------------Channel Website : http://www.nycplanespotting.weebly.comSubscribe : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...Google Plus : https://plus.google.com/b/11028113178...*NEW* Instagram : http://instagram.com/cathaya340_plane...------------------------------------------------------© CathayA340 Planespotting 2014This video may not be used without permission.",

    "Description": "For today's video, here is a full flight experience on board Delta Airlines' Boeing 717 from Newark to Atlanta!This flight was Delta Airlines Flight 2453 DAL2453/DL2453 with service to Hartsfield Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL) from Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR/EWR).The aircraft I flew was N915AT, a Boeing 717-231, which had it's first flight in March 2001, making the aircraft 13.6 years old!During the video, I was sitting in Seat 23E.FLIGHT EXPERIENCE :Information about Delta Airlines : Delta Airlines is one of the \"big 3\" carriers of the United States, and serves many destinations in the world internationally with a large variety of aircraft. Delta's fares are usually low cost and they offer good in-flight entertainment most of the time. The legroom is also good on most of their airplanes.Seats : Delta has the usual First Class and Economy Class. They offer a section called Economy Comfort which is located in the coach cabin, which has better legroom and more boarding time. Find out more about Economy Comfort on Delta's website : http://bit.ly/PUkkBvThe seat configuration of Delta's Boeing 717-200's is 2 x 3.Delta's 717 seats are comfortable, soft and have nice legroom. The recline is also pretty good for a plane like this. Find the seat information here at Delta's site : http://bit.ly/1G48wTwDelta offers USB and power ports onboard the plane throughout the ENTIRE cabin for FREE!Food/Beverage : Delta uses the standard carts to haul food and drinks around the aisles of the airplane. They offer complimentary Coca Cola beverages and 3 choices of free snacks, which include mini pretzels, cinnamon cookies and peanuts. Delta pours the drink into the a plastic cup. See the dining options here : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Flight Attendants : The flight attendants on board this flight were excellent, very accommodating and always had a smile on their faces - I can tell that they enjoyed their jobs and loved to help others! Out of my several Delta flights, all of the flight attendants were great.Turbulence : There was none during this flight, a very smooth ride. Delays : We were on schedule and arrived early on this flight! Good job to Delta for no delays :)In-Flight Entertainment : On this flight, there were no Personal TV's or any AVOD entertainment - the 717 fleet is not equipped with these because they are used for short haul routes. The entertainment included the magazines...and looking out the window ;) Just kidding...there is also On-Demand audio streaming in all classes of the 717. There is also gogo in-flight WiFi available for purchase at a low price.Baggage Costs : I did not choose to check in any bags, I put my luggage in the overhead compartments. If I did check a bag, it would have to weigh under 50 lbs and not exceed over 62 inches in total dimensions (length + width + height). And of course, you are allowed one personal item and one carry-on item for free! Anyways, please check out this link for more info on Delta's baggage policies : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Overall, Delta Airlines is the best out of the three major US carriers in my opinion. Usually, you can't go wrong with them unless there is a major problem.

    "Description": "For today's video, here is a full flight experience on board Delta Airlines' Boeing 717 from Newark to Atlanta!This flight was Delta Airlines Flight 2453 DAL2453/DL2453 with service to Hartsfield Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL) from Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR/EWR).The aircraft I flew was N915AT, a Boeing 717-231, which had it's first flight in March 2001, making the aircraft 13.6 years old!During the video, I was sitting in Seat 23E.FLIGHT EXPERIENCE :Information about Delta Airlines : Delta Airlines is one of the \"big 3\" carriers of the United States, and serves many destinations in the world internationally with a large variety of aircraft. Delta's fares are usually low cost and they offer good in-flight entertainment most of the time. The legroom is also good on most of their airplanes.Seats : Delta has the usual First Class and Economy Class. They offer a section called Economy Comfort which is located in the coach cabin, which has better legroom and more boarding time. Find out more about Economy Comfort on Delta's website : http://bit.ly/PUkkBvThe seat configuration of Delta's Boeing 717-200's is 2 x 3.Delta's 717 seats are comfortable, soft and have nice legroom. The recline is also pretty good for a plane like this. Find the seat information here at Delta's site : http://bit.ly/1G48wTwDelta offers USB and power ports onboard the plane throughout the ENTIRE cabin for FREE!Food/Beverage : Delta uses the standard carts to haul food and drinks around the aisles of the airplane. They offer complimentary Coca Cola beverages and 3 choices of free snacks, which include mini pretzels, cinnamon cookies and peanuts. Delta pours the drink into the a plastic cup. See the dining options here : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Flight Attendants : The flight attendants on board this flight were excellent, very accommodating and always had a smile on their faces - I can tell that they enjoyed their jobs and loved to help others! Out of my several Delta flights, all of the flight attendants were great.Turbulence : There was none during this flight, a very smooth ride. Delays : We were on schedule and arrived early on this flight! Good job to Delta for no delays :)In-Flight Entertainment : On this flight, there were no Personal TV's or any AVOD entertainment - the 717 fleet is not equipped with these because they are used for short haul routes. The entertainment included the magazines...and looking out the window ;) Just kidding...there is also On-Demand audio streaming in all classes of the 717. There is also gogo in-flight WiFi available for purchase at a low price.Baggage Costs : I did not choose to check in any bags, I put my luggage in the overhead compartments. If I did check a bag, it would have to weigh under 50 lbs and not exceed over 62 inches in total dimensions (length + width + height). And of course, you are allowed one personal item and one carry-on item for free! Anyways, please check out this link for more info on Delta's baggage policies : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Overall, Delta Airlines is the best out of the three major US carriers in my opinion. Usually, you can't go wrong with them unless there is a major problem. With the low prices and all the amenities you receive for free, Delta is always worth it!-----------------------------Aircraft InformationAirline : Delta Airlines DAL/DLAircraft : Boeing 717-231 B712Flight : DAL2453/DL2453Airport : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRHartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRunway : Runway 22L and 8LOrigin : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRDestination : Hartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRegistration : N915ATFlight Aware : https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N...Date of Filming : August 27, 2014Camera(s) : Canon Powershot SX-40HSVideo Editor : CyberLink PowerDirector Version 12Seat : 23ECruising Altitude : 34,000 feetSpeed : 453ktsDistance : 777 smRoute : KEWR EWR1 LANNA PTW BYRDD HAAGN PENSY EMI CSN MOL FLASK AVERY BEBAD ODF FLCON DIRTY2 KATLFlight Duration : 1 hour 38 minutesDeparture Time : 2:30 PM EDTArrival Time : 4:08PM EDT------------------------------------------------------Channel Website : http://www.nycplanespotting.weebly.comSubscribe : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...Google Plus : https://plus.google.com/b/11028113178...*NEW* Instagram : http://instagram.com/cathaya340_plane...------------------------------------------------------© CathayA340 Planespotting 2014This video may not be used without permission.",

    "Author": "CathayA340 Aviation",
    "Description": "For today's video, here is a full flight experience on board Delta Airlines' Boeing 717 from Newark to Atlanta!This flight was Delta Airlines Flight 2453 DAL2453/DL2453 with service to Hartsfield Jackson International Airport (KATL/ATL) from Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR/EWR).The aircraft I flew was N915AT, a Boeing 717-231, which had it's first flight in March 2001, making the aircraft 13.6 years old!During the video, I was sitting in Seat 23E.FLIGHT EXPERIENCE :Information about Delta Airlines : Delta Airlines is one of the \"big 3\" carriers of the United States, and serves many destinations in the world internationally with a large variety of aircraft. Delta's fares are usually low cost and they offer good in-flight entertainment most of the time. The legroom is also good on most of their airplanes.Seats : Delta has the usual First Class and Economy Class. They offer a section called Economy Comfort which is located in the coach cabin, which has better legroom and more boarding time. Find out more about Economy Comfort on Delta's website : http://bit.ly/PUkkBvThe seat configuration of Delta's Boeing 717-200's is 2 x 3.Delta's 717 seats are comfortable, soft and have nice legroom. The recline is also pretty good for a plane like this. Find the seat information here at Delta's site : http://bit.ly/1G48wTwDelta offers USB and power ports onboard the plane throughout the ENTIRE cabin for FREE!Food/Beverage : Delta uses the standard carts to haul food and drinks around the aisles of the airplane. They offer complimentary Coca Cola beverages and 3 choices of free snacks, which include mini pretzels, cinnamon cookies and peanuts. Delta pours the drink into the a plastic cup. See the dining options here : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Flight Attendants : The flight attendants on board this flight were excellent, very accommodating and always had a smile on their faces - I can tell that they enjoyed their jobs and loved to help others! Out of my several Delta flights, all of the flight attendants were great.Turbulence : There was none during this flight, a very smooth ride. Delays : We were on schedule and arrived early on this flight! Good job to Delta for no delays :)In-Flight Entertainment : On this flight, there were no Personal TV's or any AVOD entertainment - the 717 fleet is not equipped with these because they are used for short haul routes. The entertainment included the magazines...and looking out the window ;) Just kidding...there is also On-Demand audio streaming in all classes of the 717. There is also gogo in-flight WiFi available for purchase at a low price.Baggage Costs : I did not choose to check in any bags, I put my luggage in the overhead compartments. If I did check a bag, it would have to weigh under 50 lbs and not exceed over 62 inches in total dimensions (length + width + height). And of course, you are allowed one personal item and one carry-on item for free! Anyways, please check out this link for more info on Delta's baggage policies : http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_U...Overall, Delta Airlines is the best out of the three major US carriers in my opinion. Usually, you can't go wrong with them unless there is a major problem. With the low prices and all the amenities you receive for free, Delta is always worth it!-----------------------------Aircraft InformationAirline : Delta Airlines DAL/DLAircraft : Boeing 717-231 B712Flight : DAL2453/DL2453Airport : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRHartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRunway : Runway 22L and 8LOrigin : Newark Liberty International Airport KEWR/EWRDestination : Hartsfield Jackson International Airport KATL/ATLRegistration : N915ATFlight Aware : https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N...Date of Filming : August 27, 2014Camera(s) : Canon Powershot SX-40HSVideo Editor : CyberLink PowerDirector Version 12Seat : 23ECruising Altitude : 34,000 feetSpeed : 453ktsDistance : 777 smRoute : KEWR EWR1 LANNA PTW BYRDD HAAGN PENSY EMI CSN MOL FLASK AVERY BEBAD ODF FLCON DIRTY2 KATLFlight Duration : 1 hour 38 minutesDeparture Time : 2:30 PM EDTArrival Time : 4:08PM EDT------------------------------------------------------Channel Website : http://www.nycplanespotting.weebly.comSubscribe : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...Google Plus : https://plus.google.com/b/11028113178...*NEW* Instagram : http://instagram.com/cathaya340_plane...------------------------------------------------------© CathayA340 Planespotting 2014This video may not be used without permission.",
