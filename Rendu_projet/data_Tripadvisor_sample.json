We really like this lounge - nice choice of food, full range of drinks, comfortable seating, excellent shower facilities.\",\"Date_Review\":\"Hier\",\"Seat_Legroom\":\"5\",\"Seat_Comfort\":\"5\",\"Inflight_Entertainment\":\"5\",\"Overall_Service_Rating\":\"5\",\"Value_For_Money\":\"5\",\"Cleanliness\":\"5\",\"Registration\":\"5\",\"Food_And_Beverages\":\"5\",\"Airline_Name\":\"Emirates\",\"Data_Source\":\"TripAdvisor\",\"Overall_Customer_Rating\":10.0,\"Title\":\"3rd UK to Australia trip - always good service\",\"Contributions_Pers\":\"259\",\"Nb_Pertinent_Comments\":\"65\"},{\"User_Name\":\"RMChang\",\"Location\":\"Boskoop, Pays-Bas\",\"Hashtags\":[\"Amsterdam-Phuket\",\"International\",\"\\u00c9conomique\"],\"Date_Flown\":\"f\\u00e9vrier 2019\",\"Review\":\"Excellent service and spacious places.
